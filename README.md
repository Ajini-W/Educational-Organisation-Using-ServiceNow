Project Title	:	
Educational Organisation Using ServiceNow

## 📘 Project Overview
The **Educational Organisation Using ServiceNow** project aims to automate and simplify administrative and academic operations within educational institutions. Built on the ServiceNow platform, this system replaces manual processes such as paperwork, emails, and spreadsheets with a centralized digital workflow.  

The platform enables efficient management of student records, admission processes, approvals, and academic progress tracking — ensuring accuracy, transparency, and faster decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective
To create a comprehensive and automated ServiceNow application that streamlines student admissions, manages staff and academic data, and supports monitoring of institutional performance.

---

## ⚙️ Modules Implemented
### 1️⃣ Setting Up ServiceNow Instance
The ServiceNow developer instance was configured and initialized to build the educational management application. Roles, permissions, and modules were prepared for development.

### 2️⃣ Creating an Update Set
An **Update Set** was created to track configuration changes made during the development, allowing easy migration and deployment of the solution.

### 3️⃣ Creating a Table
A custom **Admission Table (u_ut_admission)** was created to store student and admission details, including fields such as Student Name, Grade, Admission Number, and Status.

### 4️⃣ Form Layout
The **Form Layout** was customized to present data fields in a structured and user-friendly way, improving usability for administrators and faculty members.

### 5️⃣ Form Design
Using the **Form Designer**, forms were enhanced with sections, related lists, and logic for easy record creation and updates.

### 6️⃣ Number Maintenance
Unique record numbers were configured for student admissions and other key records to ensure easy identification and prevent duplication.

### 7️⃣ Process Flow
A **Process Flow** was developed to automate the student admission lifecycle:
> New → In Progress → Joined → Rejoined → Closed → Canceled

This ensures consistent workflow management and eliminates manual status tracking.

### 8️⃣ Client Script
**Client Scripts** were implemented to enhance form interactivity — automatically validating inputs, triggering notifications, and dynamically updating fields based on user actions.

### 9️⃣ Result
The completed system provides a fully functional **Educational Management Platform** where administrators can manage admissions, monitor student progress, and maintain institutional data efficiently.
